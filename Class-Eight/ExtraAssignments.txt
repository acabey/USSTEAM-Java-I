Extra Assignments


If you finish everything, these are meant to be very hard so you have something to do


1. Write a program that gets 2 numbers as input, then prints out whichever one is bigger
2. Write a program that gets 2 numbers as input, then prints out “true” if either of them is in the range 10..20 inclusive. Print out “false” otherwise
3. Write a program that gets 3 numbers as input, then prints out “true” if any of the three are ‘teens’ (13, 14, 15…,19). Print out “false” otherwise
4. Write a program that will print out every number from 0 to 100
5. Write a program that will print out the odd numbers from 0 to 100
6. Write a program that gets 2 numbers as input then prints out whichever is closer to 10. If they are both equally close, print 0
7. Write a program that will print from 0 to infinity
8. Write a program that gets a number as input, then prints ‘fizz’ if it is a multiple of 3, ‘buzz’ if it is a multiple of 5, and ‘fizzbuzz’ if it is a multiple of both 3 and 5. If it is not a multiple of either, just print out the number
9. Write a program that gets 2 numbers as input, then prints out “true” if only one is a ‘teen’ (13, 14, 15…,19). Print out “false” otherwise
10. Write a program that gets 2 numbers as input, then print out “true” if the two numbers have the same ones digit. Print ‘false’ otherwise
11. Write a program that gets 2 numbers as input, then print out “true” if the two numbers have the same tens digit. Print ‘false’ otherwise
